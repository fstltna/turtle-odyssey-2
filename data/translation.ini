#COMICS_PAGE_R1=<>Place: Arctic<><>- Your pass<>- Catch it!<>- Ouch....<>

#COMICS_PAGE_L2=<>-I bumped into<>  the block of<>  ice so hard that it<>  cracked.<>  Who is this creature<>  coming out of<>  the crack?<>  Look it's so furry.<>- Ha-ha<>- Wait! Who are you?<>  Where are you from?

#COMICS_PAGE_L3=<>Place: Ozzy's homeland<>        and<>        the sea-horse house<><>- I had a wonderful<>  time in Arctic<>  and I met a strange<>  heavily furry fish.<>- There are no such.<>- But I saw it!<>- Strange.<>  I don't like it.
#COMICS_PAGE_L3_1=<>  Go to the pearl and<>  ask her about the<>  fish.<>- But the pearl is out<>  of her mind! How<>  come she might<>  know a thing about<>  the furry fish?<>- Just go....<>  It's not a good sign.<>  I feel, something bad<>  is about to happen!

#COMICS_PAGE_R4=<>- Look what I've got!<>  I told you the fish<>  exists.<>- Wow, I thought the<>  furry fish died<>  long ago.<>- So, you knew it<>  exists and you<>  haven't told me.<>- Long time ago,<>  there has been<>  a fish called Icy.
#COMICS_PAGE_R4_1=<>  It was cruel<>  and has made many<>  bad deeds to<>  all of us.<>  Most probably,<>  you accidentally<>  freed her from the<>  ice captivity.<>  You have to find<>  her and get her<>  back where<>  it belongs.
#COMICS_PAGE_R4_2=<>  The only way<>  to do it,<>  it's to sing<>  a special song<>  that would cause<>  ice to close down<>  around Icy.<>  You have to go to<>  Looking Glass city<>  to learn the song.<>- How can I get there?
#COMICS_PAGE_R4_3=<>- My grandson will<>  help you. There is<>  only one way<>  to get to<>  Looking Glass city<>  and it goes<>  through the<>  General's castle.<>- Ufff, not<>  an easy way....

#COMICS_PAGE_R5=<>  Here goes the fish.<>  And it's not alone.<>  What these two are<>  up to?<>  I'm glad I found<>  the portal, but it<>  seems they found<>  it too. I have to<>  follow them.
#COMICS_PAGE_R5_1=<>  I guess I'm going<>  to have a hard<>  time dealing with<>  them and the General<>  took a G clef that<>  opens the portal.<>  I need to solve<>  this puzzle and get<>  the G clef back.

#COMICS_PAGE_L6=<>  Here is the place where<>  the G clef belongs.<>  Lets place it there.<>  Great, the portal works<>  now and I can enter<>  Looking Glass city<>  through it.

#COMICS_PAGE_R7=<>  Well, I found the person<>  who can teach me to sing<>  the song, but nobody<>  wants to do it out of<>  free will.<>  I must win  a dancing show.<>  I will do my best.<>  I just have no other choice.
#COMICS_PAGE_R7_1=<>  A couple hours later....<>- I did it! I won the show!<>  Who is going to teach<>  me singing?<>- We will teach you,<>  but first get the notes<>  from the guitarist.

#COMICS_PAGE_L8=<>  I had 3 days of training.<>  Now, lets see how I sing<>  now. Hey, la-la-la....
#COMICS_PAGE_R8=<>  Great, ice shivers.<>  Icy, your time has come.

#COMICS_PAGE_R9=<>  Brrr, it's freezing.<>  I must find sea-horses.<>  They will tell me<>  what's going on<>  in here.<>- Hi, what's happened<>  here? Why is it so cold?<>- I'm making a pie.<>  What some?<>
#COMICS_PAGE_R9_1=<>- Don't make me to repeat<>  the question.<>- Icy found the ocean<>  heater and froze it.<>  Now the ocean is getting<>  colder and colder.<>- No time for rest.<>  I have to defeat Icy.<>  See you

#COMICS_PAGE_10=<>                          I defeated Icy. I did it!<>     Now I can invite some friends from Looking Glass city<>    and have a real party! Hey, thank goodness we've done it!
